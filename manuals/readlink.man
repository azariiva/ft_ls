#include <unistd.h>

ssize_t readlink(const char *restrict path, char *restrict buf, size_t bufsize);

readlink() places the contents of the symbolic link path in the buffer buf,
which has size bufsize.  Readlink does not append a NUL character to buf.

The call returns the count of characters placed in the buffer if it succeeds, or
a -1 if an error occurs, placing the error code in the global variable errno.
