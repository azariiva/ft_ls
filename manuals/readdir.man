#include <dirent.h>

struct dirent *readdir(DIR *dirp);


The readdir() function returns a pointer to the next directory entry.  It
returns NULL upon reaching the end of the directory or on error.  In the event
of an error, errno may be set to any of the values documented for the
getdirentries(2)
system call.  Note that the order of the directory entries vended by readdir()
is not specified. Some filesystems may return entries in lexicographic sort
order and others may not.
